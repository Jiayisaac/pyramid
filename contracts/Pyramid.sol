contract Pyramid {
    /*
    This smart contract IS a Pyramid Payment Scheme  - you have been forewarned!
    There is nothing to hide - this code has been deployed here on the public ethereum blockchain for all to read and review.
    The idea here is just to have some fun!
    
    How does this particular pyramid payment scheme work:
        Each member pays 0.05 ETH to join
        Membership payments from new members are distributed up the line so that the person who recruited
        them receives 50%, the person who recruited them received 25%, then 12.5% and so on and so on.       
        New members must state the address of their referrer / recruiter and will be added to their line
        
        Each recruit only needs to recruit two people to make back their initial investment.
        Any further new members within their line will represent pure profit.
        
        The exact payment equation is given by:
        Payment Share % = e**-kd        (where k=0.693147180559945 and d=distance from new subscriber)
        
        This is illustrated in the table below:
        =============================================
        |   Distance from new member    |   Share   |
        =============================================
        |   1 (immediate recruiter)     |   50%     |
        =============================================
        |   2                           |   25%     |
        =============================================
        |   3                           |   12.5%   |
        =============================================
        |   4                           |   6.25%   |
        =============================================
        |   5                           |   3.13%   |
        =============================================
        |   6                           |   1.56%   |
        =============================================
        |   7                           |   0.78%   |
